              Hello there, welcome to my portfolio. I am a senior web developer
              who is comfortable with architecting and implementing scalable and
              maintainable web app/services with the TDD/BDD approach..
              <br />
              <br />
              Specifically, I have long been focusing on responsive web
              application development with
              React.js/Redux/Styled-Component/Material-UI, Angular 2+,
              Vue.js/Vuex/Vuetify, Node.js, Laravel, WordPress, Webflow, PHP,
              ES6/7, TypesScript, HTML5, CSS3, and etc.
              <br />
              <br />
              During my career, I have participated in a wide range of web
              projects ( e-commerce, real estate, social media platforms,
              fintech ), and learned how to collaborate with team members, great
              attitude in the development process, project management, meet
              deadlines, and risk management.
              <br />
