              Hello there, welcome to my portfolio.
              <br />
              This is Roy and I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and coming up with solutions in a timely manner. I thrive in team settings, and I think my skill in effectively communicating with others is what drives my ability to solve a variety of problems.
              <br />
              <br />
              Here are my best quotes for development.
              <br />
              <br />
              "First solve the problem, then write the code"
              <br />
              "I love what I do and I do what my clients love & work with great clients all over the world to create thoughtful and purposeful websites." 
              <br />
              <br />
              During my career, I have participated in a wide range of web
              projects ( e-commerce, real estate, social media platforms,
              fintech ), and learned how to collaborate with team members, great
              attitude in the development process, project management, meet
              deadlines, and risk management.
              <br />
